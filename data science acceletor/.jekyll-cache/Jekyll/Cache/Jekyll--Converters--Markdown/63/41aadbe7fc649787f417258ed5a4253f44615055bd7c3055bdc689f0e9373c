<p>This accelerator operates a bit different to your previous data science track. While the Digital Shaper Program combines learning on your own, a local community &amp; practice in a group project; the accelerator only focuses on the community and practice, by introducing new concepts to combine them even more. This page explains the differences between the two programs, as well as how the learning and your experience will differ.</p>
