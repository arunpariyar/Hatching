  <li>Please fill out your Slack Profile, Status and upload a picture.</li>
  <li>Treat Slack as you treat email: read often, and reply often (we recommend once a day, at least)</li>
  <li>Engage in conversation, reply to questions, even if only by selecting an emoji reaction to the messages. This goes a long way to show people are listening!</li>
  <li>Do not be afraid to post questions, interesting links, or anything you may judge of general interest to the community</li>
  <li>Answer in threads, which makes the discussion easier to follow and more focused.</li>
</ul>
