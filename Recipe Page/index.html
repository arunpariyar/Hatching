          Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake
          recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny
          its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.

                <span class="step">1</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat
                oven to 350°F (177°C).
              </p>
              <p><span class="step">2</span></p>
              <p>
                <span class="u-bold">Make the crust:</span> Using a food
                processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a
                medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined.
                (You can also pulse it all together in the food processor.)
                Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly
                up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to
                grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to
                pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from
                the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum
                foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in
                step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="step">3</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="u-bold">Make the filling:</span> Using a handheld
                or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream
                cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a
                large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2
                minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice
                then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs
                one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended.
                After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
                mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and
                cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you
                can.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="step">4</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="u-bold"
                  >Prepare the simple water bath (see note)
                </span>
                Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting
                pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an
                entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the
                aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake
                batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to
                smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large
                roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and
                place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the
                oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for
                you.)
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="step">5</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost
                set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly
                wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
                the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in
                the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven
                and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room
                temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4
                hours or overnight.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="step">6</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
                springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife,
                cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife
                clean and dip into warm water between each slice.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="step">7</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
                cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
