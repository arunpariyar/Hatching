  "description": "The Annapurna base camp trek is one of the most popular treks in the world. It literally brings you face to face with an eight-thousander – for a moderate-difficult trek, this is incredible! The fascinating Annapurna massif includes the world’s tenth highest peak. Annapurna I (8,091 m) holds an almost fatal attraction for mountaineers. It has the highest fatality ratio among the eight-thousanders. This formidable aura apart, the ABC trek holds several treasures for the mountain lover.",
